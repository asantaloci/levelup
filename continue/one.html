  There’s a new retro videogame that just came out, and you just bought your very own copy for Halloween.
  You know that it has a lot of reviews online, but you don’t know too much about it besides it being a “crazy” game.
  However, you haven’t played a videogame in the past 24 hours so you open the disk player, insert the disk, and start the game.
