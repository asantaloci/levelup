  There must have been a reason why the game gave you a flashlight,
  so you quickly pull it out of your pocket and shine the abnormally bright
  ray of light on the oily, dark monster.
</br>
</br>
  It tries to move out of the lightâ€™s way, but you steady your tool on the creature,
  watching it slowly dissolve. Once it had fully dissipated,
  the trapdoor below you suddenly glows a brighter red,
  and you take this as a sign of hope. </p>
